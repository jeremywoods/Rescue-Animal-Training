How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is important in identifying bugs in processes and allowing for easier development. Having modular code streamlined my development for the CRUD functions in animal_shelter.py as the syntax for each CRUD function is incredibly similar. Having developed modular code I only needed to make minor changes to each CRUD function as they have different effects on the database. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist you must fully understand what the client wants to accomplishg. In this case, Grazioso Salvare wanted to create a software that is easy to use for themselves, however, can be easily adaptable for any other rescue organization worldwide. MongoDB and Python are both user-friendly languages that one with moderate computer experience could figure out if going along with documentation. The use of MongoDB and Python was further cemented as we were able to use PyMongo to execute CRUD functions. I would use similar strategies such as this when meeting future client requests. All software development should begin with considering the needs of the client and creating a plan from there.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists take needs as declared by the client and create solutions. In this case, Grazioso Salvare was looking for a means to quickly identify candidates for rescue dog training. We were able to automate this process by pulling information from local animal shelters and defining processes that search for based on the attributes set forth for each rescue category by the client.
